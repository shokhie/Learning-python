Playing with [sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket).

## What is a socket ?
If two processes want to communicate with each other, then they use
sockets. There are many ways in which inter-process communincation([ipc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication#Approaches)) 
can be acheived but for cross platform communications, sockets are the best. 

                   It serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across
the network.

### Socket types
